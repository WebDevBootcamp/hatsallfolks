Hats All Folks is a hat sales website developed as a final project for the WebLab Boot Camp at Front Range Community College in May, 2015. The team was Mike Youtz, Brad Ayers, and Jack LeRoi. The live site is weblab.us/hatsall/start. The majority of the graphic design was by Mike, while Brad and Jack did the Javascript and PHP coding and the database design and management. It is a prototype and not everything works perfectly right now. We're still upgrading it with features and ideas. Check back next week to see what's new.
